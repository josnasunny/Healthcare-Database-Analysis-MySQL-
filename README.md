# Healthcare-Database-Analysis-MySQL-
A SQL-based data analysis project on a healthcare relational database. The project answers real-world business questions related to prescriptions, medicines, diseases, pharmacies, and insurance claims using advanced MySQL queries.

Overview

This project is about understanding and fixing real-world SQL queries using a healthcare database. The focus is not just on writing SQL from scratch, but on analyzing existing queries, identifying errors, and rewriting them so they work correctly in MySQL.This project reflects common tasks faced by data analysts, such as debugging broken queries, aligning them with the database schema, and improving clarity and correctness.

Objectives

Analyze healthcare business problem statements
Debug non-optimized SQL queries
Fix join, column, and aggregation errors
Rewrite queries for MySQL compatibility

What I Did

Worked with healthcare-related business questions
Reviewed non-optimized and error-prone SQL queries
Identified issues like wrong joins, missing columns, and schema mismatches
Rewrote the queries into clean and correct MySQL-compatible SQL

Database Context

The healthcare database includes information related to:
Patients and their demographic details
Addresses and cities
Pharmacies and insurance companies
Prescriptions and medicines
Diseases and insurance claims

A schema diagram is provided to clearly understand table relationships and column structures.
